                        The main utensils used in Japan are chopsticks. The use of chopsticks has been part of Japanese
                        culture for a long time, and it remains, to this day, the most commonly used utensil in Japan.
                        It originated from China, when Emperor Suiko sent a delegation to China in order to study their
                        culture. The delegation saw the Chinese people using chopsticks and brought them back to Japan.
                        It is said that the original purpose for starting to use chopsticks was to be able to invite
                        Chinese envoys to Japan. From there, eating with chopsticks became commonplace within the upper
                        class and soon everybody ate with them.

                            Japan has a lot of manners and customs that revolve around eating. They are far more strict
                            than most other countries as well. Some examples of the manners and customs that are used in
                            meals are the greetings, "Itadakimasu" and "Gochisosama desita" (Thank you for the food),
                            eating with your hands on the bowl or bowls, and many others that are very specific. On top
                            of those, there are many customs that you see all over the world that are in use in Japan as
                            well, such as not eating with your elbows on the table, not eating noisily…

                            Japan has a lot of unique foods that are not found in many other countries. The Japanese
                            diet is rich in fish, seafood, and plant based foods. This makes it a very healthy diet that
                            is low in added sugars and carbs. Some common foods in Japan are sushi (typically fish
                            rolled in rice and wrapped in seaweed), ramen(a noodle dish), miso soup…
